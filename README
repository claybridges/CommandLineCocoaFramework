CommandLineCocoaFramework

This creates a minimal Cocoa framework -- called Min -- from the command line,
using the Nu make tool, nuke. The framework contains a single class, Min, with 
a single method -yo, just for verification. In addition, framework initialization
seems to require the existence of an initialization C function, so I just put that
in the class file.

From what I can tell, nuke is not as fully baked as, say, rake. On the other
hand, it has built-in support for frameworks, and did the job in 10 lines of
code. Not too shabby.

If you "nuke install", this will install under "/Library/Frameworks". nuke
seems to occasionally segfault when running on top of a dirty framework,
so in that case, just "nuke clobber; nuke install".

My only bar for success was whether I could get the framework to successfully
load in the nu & macruby shells, nush & macirb. Here's the results:

gort:~ clay$ macirb
irb(main):001:0> framework "Min"
=> true
irb(main):002:0> Min.yo
=> "'Sup. I'm the Min framework."

Nu Shell.
% (load "Min")
t
% (Min yo)
"'Sup. I'm the Min framework."

I welcome other ways to do this, e.g. make, rake, macrake, etc. Send me
a push request.
